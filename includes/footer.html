    <p>After Eclipse took out DeviantArt, I made Charadex to help other species creators organize and keep easier track of their masterlist.</p>

    <p>And it's not limited to species! If you just sell adopts or what to make a little organizer for your characters - this might help. I use it to keep track of role play AU's and my own designs too!</p>
